        </h2>
        <p>
        I am a fourth-year graduate student in Astronomy at Caltech
        and an <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF Graduate Research Fellow.</a>
        My advisor is <a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~srk/" target="_blank">Shri Kulkarni</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        I study a rare, extreme class of stellar death:
        explosions powered by a central engine,
        like an accreting black hole or a spinning neutron star.
        For the last half-century, these "engine-driven" explosions
        have predominantly been discovered using gamma-ray satellites.
        However, a new generation of wide-field optical surveys
        (such as the
        <a href="https://www.ptf.caltech.edu/ztf" target="_blank">Zwicky Transient Facility, ZTF</a>)
        are showing us that the landscape of these explosions is more diverse
        than we had imagined, including members invisible to high-energy detectors
        (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1712.00949"

        </p>
        <p>
        I am also interested in developing infrastructure for
        industrial-scale astronomy.
        Before coming to Caltech,
        I spent a year on a
        <a href="https://us.fulbrightonline.org/about/fulbright-us-student-program" target="_blank">Fulbright</a>
        at the 
        <a href="http://www.mpia.de/en" target="_blank">Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (MPIA)</a> in Heidelberg, Germany.
        There, I worked with
        <a href="http://www.mpia.de/rix" target="_blank">Hans-Walter Rix</a>, 
        <a href="http://www2.mpia-hd.mpg.de/home/ness/Welcome.html" target="_blank">Melissa Ness</a>, and 
        <a href="http://cosmo.nyu.edu/hogg/" target="_blank">David Hogg</a>
        on <a href="https://annayqho.github.io/TheCannon/" target="_blank">The Cannon</a>.
        I used The Cannon to transfer information from a high-S/N,
        high-resolution survey to low-resolution, noisy spectra,
        resulting in the largest catalog of
        stellar masses and ages to-date
        (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1602.00303"

        I obtained my B.S. in Physics at MIT.
        As an undergraduate, I spent three summers at the 
        National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO).
        At the NRAO, I worked with 
        <a href="https://www.cv.nrao.edu/~sransom/" target="_blank">Scott Ransom</a> 
        on using millisecond pulsars
        in the globular cluster Terzan 5 to measure small-scale structure
        in the magnetic field of the Milky Way.

        </h3>
        <p>
            In the death of a massive star, the core collapses into a black hole
            and a spherical shock unbinds the outer layers in a core-collapse supernova.
            In rare cases (0.1%), the rapidly spinning black hole acts as an engine
            that drives a relativistic bipolar jet, which tunnels through the star
            and is visible to us as a gamma-ray burst (GRB).
            Recent evidence suggests that GRBs are just the tip of the iceberg of
            a much broader landscape of jet and central engine phenomena.
            This landscape could include jets with a higher baryon loading fraction
            ("dirty fireballs"), choked jets, and jets that are viewed off-axis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Undertaking the first census of these phenomena is one of the primary
            goals of the 
            <a href="https://www.ptf.caltech.edu/ztf">Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)</a>. 
            We will address key physical questions such as:
            How many SNe actually produce central engines? 
            Why do ``classical" GRB jets accelerate only a tiny fraction of their mass?
            Do low-luminosity GRBs result from jets getting choked within the star?
            And, finally, how accurate is our understanding of beaming in GRBs?
        </p>
        <p>
            False positives such as flaring stars and AGN present an impediment
            to discovering relativistic transients. 
            To address this issue, 
            I conducted a
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00949">systematic search of the iPTF archive</a>
            to develop a strategy for mitigation. 
            I have also been using the Very Large Array (VLA) to follow up 
            a mysterious population of short soft X-ray flashes 
            discovered by the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI). 
            The short duration, flux, hardness ratio, 
            and lack of known counterpart to these events makes them promising
            candidate dirty fireballs.

        </h3>
        <p>
        A new generation of large-scale spectroscopic stellar surveys
        (e.g. SEGUE, APOGEE, Gaia-ESO) are measuring spectra for millions
        of stars across the Milky Way.
        Ideally, each spectrum would be used to "label" the corresponding
        star with its physical characteristics (e.g. temperature)
        and physical labels would be independent of the
        pipeline used to measure them.
        However, in practice, 
        survey pipelines measure inconsistent labels for the same stars,
        because their methodologies are sensitive to properties that differ between surveys (e.g. wavelength range and resolution).
        </p>
        <p>
        <i> The Cannon </i> is a data-driven approach to spectral modeling
        that can be used to bring two discrepant surveys onto the same scale.
        <i> The Cannon</i> requires no physical models, is very fast,
        and achieves comparable accuracy to existing survey pipelines
        but with significantly lower SNR spectra.
        It relies only on the existence of a subset of objects within a survey
        for which the corresponding labels are known and sufficiently cover
        the label space of interest.

        </h3>
        <p>
            Our position within the Milky Way gives us a unique
            vantage point: we can measure the galactic magnetic
            field shape and structure over several orders of magnitude, 
            ranging from parsec to several parsec scales.
            The dense millisecond pulsar (MSP) populations in
            globular clusters (GCs) provide a unique opportunity to
            measure and map the galactic magnetic field on small
            (pc) scales, using the Faraday rotation technique.
        </p>
        <p>
            The globular cluster Terzan 5 has the highest-known
            population of MSPs: radio flux measurements predict
            a much higher total than the current population of 35.
            Ransom (2007) used timing solutions for each MSP to calculate
            precise positions and precise DMs to demonstrate that
            differences in DM are dominated by electron density fluctuations
            in the ISM, rather than within the cluster.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a summer student at the NRAO (a program funded by the NSF)
            I used nearly five full days of 1.5 GHz and 2 GHz Green Bank
            Telescope data to calculate precise rotation measures (RMs) for 24
            of the 35 millisecond pulsars in Terzan 5.
            Dividing these values by the corresponding DMs enabled me to measure
            the mean line-of-sight galactic magnetic field strength to
            each pulsar. I found a 15-20% gradient in line-of-sight magnetic
            field strength across the cluster with fluctuations on the order
            of 0.1 microGauss and measured a structure function power law index
            of alpha = 1.13 +/- 0.15.

            I enjoy public speaking, and have given numerous talks
            at academic conferences and at our department's journal club,
            as well as for the general public.
            On invitation, I taught a 2-day workshop on
            using <i>The Cannon</i> at Gemini Observatory in La Serena, Chile:
            I gave a talk and led a series of hands-on sessions,
            guiding the participants through Jupyter notebooks and datasets
            that I prepared.

            <p> Recognized as one of three "outstanding TAs"
            by the Office of Graduate Studies and the Registrar's Office.
            From the Registrar Newsletter:
            "Students described Anna as caring, considerate, and committed...
            as well as being extremely effective at explaining and summarizing
            the course material. The sentiments in this quote were echoed
            by several other students: 'She was consistently well-prepared
            for section, gave really good notes, and did a really good job of
            explaining potentially confusing material and clarifying
            misunderstandings. She was very in-tune with the difficulties
            students were having and did a very good job of resolving those
            difficulties.'" </p>
