        </h2>
        <p>
        I am a third-year graduate student in Astrophysics at Caltech, working
        with <a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~srk/" target="_blank">Shri Kulkarni</a>.
        I am interested in understanding the physics of stellar death
        by using wide-field time-domain facilities to searching for afterglows
        independent of prompt high-energy emission. 
        Currently, I am preparing to use the 
        <a href="https://www.ptf.caltech.edu/ztf" target="_blank">Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)</a>
        to search for elusive variations on the gamma-ray burst model:
        orphan afterglows and dirty fireballs.
        </p>

        <p>
        Before coming to Caltech, I obtained a B.S. in Physics at MIT
        and spent three summers at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO).
        At the NRAO, I worked with <a href="https://www.cv.nrao.edu/~sransom/" target="_blank">Scott Ransom</a> on using millisecond pulsars
        in the globular cluster Terzan 5 to measure small-scale structure
        in the magnetic field of the Milky Way.
        I then spent a year on a Fulbright Scholarship at the Max Planck Institute
        for Astronomy (MPIA) in Heidelberg, Germany. 
        At the MPIA, I worked with 
        <a href="http://www.mpia.de/rix" target="_blank">Hans-Walter Rix</a>, 
        <a href="http://www2.mpia-hd.mpg.de/home/ness/Welcome.html" target="_blank">Melissa Ness</a>, and 
        <a href="http://cosmo.nyu.edu/hogg/" target="_blank">David Hogg</a>
        on a data-driven approach to spectral modeling called 
        <a href="https://annayqho.github.io/TheCannon/" target="_blank">The Cannon</a>.
        By <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1602.00303" target="_blank">using The Cannon to reanalyze the LAMOST spectra of 450,000 giants</a>,
        my work resulted in <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1609.03195" target="_blank">the largest catalog to-date</a> of stellar masses,
        ages, and individual abundances (alpha enhancement, carbon, and nitrogen).

        </h3>
        <p>
            The most well-studied class of engine-driven relativistic explosions,
            classical long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), may simply be one
            manifestation of a broader landcsape of phenomena that includes
            jets with a higher baryon loading fraction (``dirty fireballs")
            and jets that are viewed off-axis (``orphan afterglows").
            Dirty fireballs and orphan afterglows have long been predicted
            to exist, but none have been found.
        </p>
        <p>
            Discovering and characterizing the first dirty fireballs and orphan
            afterglows is one of the primary goals of the Zwicky Transient
            Facility (ZTF). ZTF is on the verge of first light:
            the survey will begin in January 2018 and run for three years.
            With its wide field of view and rapid survey speed,
            ZTF represents the best opportunity to date of finally uncovering
            (or severely constraining) these elusive events.
        </p>
        <p>
            To prepare myself for this enterprise, 
            I have been working on two projects. 
            First, I am conducting a systematic search of the iPTF archive
            in order to characterize the foreground of
            false positives and develop a strategy for mitigation. 
            This has resulted in a set of criteria that
            distinguishes known GRB afterglows from M-dwarfs 
            and other false positives. Second, I have
            been using the Very Large Array (VLA) to follow up 
            the mysterious population of short soft X-ray flashes 
            discovered by the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI). 
            The short duration, flux, hardness ratio, 
            and lack of known counterpart to these events makes them promising
            candidate dirty fireballs.

            <a id="cannon" class="anchor" href="#cannon" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Data-Driven Spectral Modeling using <i>The Cannon</i>
        </h3>
        <p>
        A new generation of large-scale spectroscopic stellar surveys
        (e.g. SEGUE, APOGEE, Gaia-ESO) are measuring spectra for millions
        of stars across the Milky Way.
        Ideally, each spectrum would be used to "label" the corresponding
        star with its physical characteristics, such as its effective temperature
        and element abundances, and physical labels would be independent of the
        pipeline used to measure them.
        However, in practice, reliably and consistently determining labels
        from vast datasets of spectra constitutes a formidable modeling challenge.
        Currently, survey pipelines measure inconsistent labels for the same stars,
        because their methodologies are sensitive to properties that differ between surveys (e.g. wavelength range and resolution).
        </p>
        <p>
        <i> The Cannon </i> is a new data-driven method for spectral modeling
        that can be used to bring two discrepant surveys onto the same scale.
        <i> The Cannon</i> requires no physical models, is very fast,
        and achieves comparable accuracy to existing survey pipelines
        but with significantly lower SNR spectra.
        It relies only on the existence of a subset of objects within a survey
        for which the corresponding labels are known and sufficiently cover
        the label space of interest.
        </p>
        <p>
        I used <i>The Cannon</i> to reanalyze the spectra of 450,000
        giant stars from the LAMOST survey.
        I improved the precision on existing measurements, and made
        the first measurements of several other parameters.
        Taken together, this work represents the largest catalog to date
        of stellar [alpha/M], [C/M], [N/M], mass, and age.
        This work resulted in two first-author publications, several
        co-author publications (including one recently submitted to <i>Nature</i>),
        and several invited and contributed conference talks.
        I also wrote a version of <i>The Cannon</i> for use by the community,
        along with detailed documentation and two tutorials.

        </h3>
        <p>
            Our position within the Milky Way gives us a unique
            vantage point: we can measure the galactic magnetic
            field shape and structure over several orders of magnitude, 
            ranging from parsec to several parsec scales.
            The dense millisecond pulsar (MSP) populations in
            globular clusters (GCs) provide a unique opportunity to
            measure and map the galactic magnetic field on small
            (pc) scales, using the Faraday rotation technique.
        </p>
        <p>
            The globular cluster Terzan 5 has the highest-known
            population of MSPs: radio flux measurements predict
            a much higher total than the current population of 35.
            Ransom (2007) used timing solutions for each MSP to calculate
            precise positions and precise DMs to demonstrate that
            differences in DM are dominated by electron density fluctuations
            in the ISM, rather than within the cluster.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a summer student at the NRAO (a program funded by the NSF)
            I used nearly five full days of 1.5 GHz and 2 GHz Green Bank
            Telescope data to calculate precise rotation measures (RMs) for 24
            of the 35 millisecond pulsars in Terzan 5.
            Dividing these values by the corresponding DMs enabled me to measure
            the mean line-of-sight galactic magnetic field strength to
            each pulsar. I found a 15-20% gradient in line-of-sight magnetic
            field strength across the cluster with fluctuations on the order
            of 0.1 microGauss and measured a structure function power law index
            of alpha = 1.13 +/- 0.15.

            I designed and taught <a href="http://annastronomer.tumblr.com/post/109665878629/cosmology-hands-on" target="_blank">
            a cosmology workshop</a> for local high-school students. </li>
            <li> McCormick Public Observatory, Charlottesville VA: 
            During my first weekend doing an internship at the NRAO, 
            I asked the director of the nearby
            McCormick Observatory whether I could give talks over the summer.
            He agreed. This led to a volunteering program for the NRAO summer
            interns, which I started and organized. </li>
        </ul>

        <h4> Classroom Teaching </h4>
        I have been designing and teaching classes for the public
        since my freshman year at MIT. 
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li> MIT: I spent one month with Teach For America, teaching math
            on the Pueblo Pintado Navajo reservation. 
            Over the next few years, I taught over 12 different classes
            for over 500 middle- and high-school students and their parents
            through MIT's 
            <a href="https://esp.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Educational Studies Program (ESP)</a>. 
            The subject material has ranged from scientific
            (e.g. an eight-week course on cosmology)
            to literary (e.g. a three-hour dramatic reading of Tom Stoppard's
            <i>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead</i> 
            to improvised (e.g. 
            <a href="http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/spontaneous-5-minute-classes-on-whatever-you-want" target="_blank">improvised 5-minute lessons</a> with
            topics decided by the audience on the spot).
            During my junior year, MIT sponsored me to travel as an
            ambassador to Stanford to teach for their ESP program.
            <li> Pasadena: I designed and taught an eight-week class
           on multiwavelegnth astronomy for gifted 7-12 year olds at the 
           <a href="http://educationaladvancement.org/" target="_blank">Institute for Educational Advancement</a>.
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h4> Writing </h4>
        <ul>
            <li> MIT Blog: Prior to arriving on the MIT campus, I was one of four
            members of the Class of 2014 selected to be 
            <a href="http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/profile/annayq" target="_blank">an MIT admissions</a>
            blogger. Over the next four years, I wrote 
            <a href="http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/author/annayq/archives" target="_blank"> biweekly blog posts</a>
            with the goal of making undergraduate life more transparent
            to prospective students from around the world.
            The website is visited by a quarter of a million people per month,
            and I enjoyed corresponding with prospective students,
            answering questions about science careers, and offering
            suggestions for high school preparation. 
            One of my blog posts was <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2011/my-four-weeks-view-us-achievement-gap" target="_blank">featured</a> on the MIT News website
            and <a href="https://aas.org/posts/blog/2014/04/congressional-visits-day-undergraduate-perspective">another</a> by the AAS.
            </li>
            <li> MIT Science Writing: I won First Place in the 
            <a href="http://cmsw.mit.edu/publications/ilona-karmel-writing-prizes/" target="_blank"> DeWitt Wallace Prize</a> for Science Writing for the Public
            and was awarded an
            <a href="http://odge.mit.edu/finances/fellowships/odgefellowships/#green" target="_blank">Ida M. Green Fellowship</a> from the Science Writing department. </li>
        </ul>
