        </h3>
        <p>
        I am a third-year graduate student in Astrophysics at Caltech, working
        with <a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~srk/" target="_blank">Shri Kulkarni</a>.
        I am interested in understanding the physics of stellar death
        by using wide-field time-domain facilities to searching for afterglows
        independent of prompt high-energy emission. 
        Currently, I am preparing to use the 
        <a href="https://www.ptf.caltech.edu/ztf" target="_blank">Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)</a>
        to search for elusive variations on the gamma-ray burst model:
        orphan afterglows and dirty fireballs.
        </p>

        <p>
        Before coming to Caltech, I obtained a B.S. in Physics at MIT
        and spent three summers at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO).
        At the NRAO, I worked with <a href="https://www.cv.nrao.edu/~sransom/" target="_blank">Scott Ransom</a> on using millisecond pulsars
        in the globular cluster Terzan 5 to measure small-scale structure
        in the magnetic field of the Milky Way.
        I then spent a year on a Fulbright Scholarship at the Max Planck Institute
        for Astronomy (MPIA) in Heidelberg, Germany. 
        At the MPIA, I worked with 
        <a href="http://www.mpia.de/rix" target="_blank">Hans-Walter Rix</a>, 
        <a href="http://www2.mpia-hd.mpg.de/home/ness/Welcome.html" target="_blank">Melissa Ness</a>, and 
        <a href="http://cosmo.nyu.edu/hogg/" target="_blank">David Hogg</a>
        on a data-driven approach to spectral modeling called 
        <a href="https://annayqho.github.io/TheCannon/" target="_blank">The Cannon</a>.
        By <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1602.00303" target="_blank">using The Cannon to reanalyze the LAMOST spectra of 450,000 giants</a>,
        my work resulted in <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1609.03195" target="_blank">the largest catalog to-date</a> of stellar masses,
        ages, and individual abundances (alpha enhancement, carbon, and nitrogen).

        </h3>
        <p>
            The most well-studied class of engine-driven relativistic explosions,
            classical long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), may simply be one
            manifestation of a broader landcsape of phenomena that includes
            jets with a higher baryon loading fraction (``dirty fireballs")
            and jets that are viewed off-axis (``orphan afterglows").
            Dirty fireballs and orphan afterglows have long been predicted
            to exist, but none have been found.
        </p>
        <p>
            Discovering and characterizing the first dirty fireballs and orphan
            afterglows is one of the primary goals of the Zwicky Transient
            Facility (ZTF). ZTF is on the verge of first light:
            the survey will begin in January 2018 and run for three years.
            With its wide field of view and rapid survey speed,
            ZTF represents the best opportunity to date of finally uncovering
            (or severely constraining) these elusive events.
        </p>
        <p>
            To prepare myself for this enterprise, 
            I have been working on two projects. 
            First, I am conducting a systematic search of the iPTF archive
            in order to characterize the foreground of
            false positives and develop a strategy for mitigation. 
            This has resulted in a set of criteria that
            distinguishes known GRB afterglows from M-dwarfs 
            and other false positives. Second, I have
            been using the Very Large Array (VLA) to follow up 
            the mysterious population of short soft X-ray flashes 
            discovered by the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI). 
            The short duration, flux, hardness ratio, 
            and lack of known counterpart to these events makes them promising
            candidate dirty fireballs.
