        </h2>
        <p>
        Here is a tool to visualize superbias frames from the
        month of November.
        For a given night, each superbias frame was constructed as follows:
        <ul>
            <li> Each bias frame was median-subtracted
            <li> All bias frames were median-combined
        </ul>
        The preliminary median-subtraction was done in order to remove
        time-dependent variation and leave only spatial variation.
