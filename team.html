                <p> Harlan Phillips: Harlan began studying Computer Science at Bakersfield College where he was previously interning at NASA. At NASA, he created a tool using machine learning to analyze space radiation experiments. In the summer of 2024, he joined Dr. Anna Ho at Cornell University where he is developing a web application to classify over 250,000 transients. Harlan enjoys snowboarding, boxing, reading, and loves mentoring the youth. In the fall he will be transferring to UC Berkeley and begin his NASA Pathways program at Johnson Space Center.

                <p>Maggie Li: Maggie recently graduated from Cornell, where she majored in physics with a minor in astronomy. Her research with Professor Ho uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to constrain the origins of afterglows with no observed gamma-ray burst counterparts. In her free time, she likes to draw, play fighting games, and hang out with her cat. Starting in Fall 2024 Maggie will be a PhD student at Caltech. </p>

                <p>Joshua Grajales: Joshua began studying Astronomy and Computer Science at Wesleyan University. At Wesleyan, he worked with Dr. Meredith Hughes, where he compared dynamical mass estimates of gas-bearing debris disk host stars with those from stellar evolutionary models. In the summer of 2023, he joined Dr. Anna Ho at Cornell University where he worked towards developing an optical transient detection tool. Outside of research and academics, Joshua enjoys playing soccer, video games, working out, and expanding his culinary palette and skills with family and friends. Joshua is currently attending Columbia University studying operations research.</p>
