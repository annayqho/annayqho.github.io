        <p>
        My expertise is in time-domain astronomy, particularly the use of
        ground-based optical surveys for large-scale supernova discovery
        and classification (e.g. ZTF),
        and in developing data-driven tools for modeling spectra using
        massively multiplexed spectrographs (e.g. LAMOST).
        My primary scientific interests are engine-driven explosions
        (gamma-ray burst afterglows, AT2018cow) and pre-supernova mass-loss.

        </h3>
        <p>
        With the commissioning of wide-field high-cadence optical surveys such 
        as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), large fractions of the sky are
        being monitored on nightly or faster cadences, enabling the first 
        systematic exploration of the fast and luminous corner of transient 
        phase-space. For my thesis, I am using ZTF to discover fast-luminous 
        transients in real-time, and watch 
        them unfold with telescopes across the electromagnetic spectrum. 
        My filters enabled the discovery of ZTF18abukavn (SN2018gep), 
        discovered as a rapidly rising transient (1.4 mag/hr) only 20 minutes 
        after shock breakout and spectroscopically classified
        as a Ic-BL SN.
        The early discovery enabled an intensive spectroscopic campaign, 
        including the earliest spectral sequence of a stripped-envelope supernova to-date. 
        A retrospective search revealed emission in the weeks prior to explosion.
        Taken together, we concluded that the data are best explained
        by shock breakout in a massive shell of dense circumstellar material
        that was ejected in eruptive pre-explosion mass-loss episodes.
        Our results suggest that late-stage eruptive mass-loss may be present
        in a greater variety of massive stars than had been previously thought.

        </h3>
        <p>
           The explosion AT2018cow (“The Cow”) was undoubtedly the biggest 
            surprise in time-domain astronomy in 2018. 
            I led a study using millimeter-wavelength and X-ray telescopes 
            that showed that The Cow was likely powered by a central engine, 
            a newborn black hole or neutron star. 
            I established that this new class of explosions are prime targets 
            for millimeter-wavelength observatories such as the Submillimeter 
            Array (SMA), traditionally not used to study cosmic explosions.

        </h3>
        <p>
        Today, the quality of stellar spectra from large-scale surveys such as
        APOGEE has surpassed the precision of
        the physical models used to fit them.
        <i> The Cannon </i> is a data-driven approach to spectral modeling
        that transfers information from high-quality, high-SNR data
        to lower quality, low-SNR data. This approach can be used to bring
        qualitatively different surveys onto the same scale.

        </h3>
        <p>
            The dense millisecond pulsar (MSP) populations in
            globular clusters (GCs) provide a unique opportunity to
            measure and map the galactic magnetic field on small 
            (pc) scales, using the Faraday rotation technique.
            The globular cluster Terzan 5 has the highest-known
            population of MSPs: radio flux measurements predict
            a much higher total than the current population of 35.
            As a summer student at the NRAO (a program funded by the NSF)
            I used nearly five full days of 1.5 GHz and 2 GHz Green Bank
            Telescope data to calculate precise rotation measures (RMs) for 24
            of the 35 millisecond pulsars in Terzan 5.
            Dividing these values by the corresponding DMs enabled me to measure
            the mean line-of-sight galactic magnetic field strength to
            each pulsar. I found a 15-20% gradient in line-of-sight magnetic
            field strength across the cluster with fluctuations on the order
            of 0.1 microGauss and measured a structure function power law index
            of alpha = 1.13 +/- 0.15.
