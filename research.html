        <p>
        My expertise is in time-domain astronomy, particularly the use of
        ground-based optical surveys for large-scale supernova discovery
        and classification (e.g. ZTF),
        and in developing data-driven tools for modeling spectra using
        massively multiplexed spectrographs (e.g. LAMOST).
        My primary scientific interests are engine-driven explosions
        (gamma-ray burst afterglows, AT2018cow) and pre-supernova mass-loss.

        </h3>
        <p>
           The explosion AT2018cow (“The Cow”) was undoubtedly the biggest 
            surprise in time-domain astronomy in 2018. 
            I led a study using millimeter-wavelength and X-ray telescopes 
            that showed that The Cow was likely powered by a central engine, 
            a newborn black hole or neutron star. 
            I established that this new class of explosions are prime targets 
            for millimeter-wavelength observatories such as the Submillimeter 
            Array (SMA), traditionally not used to study cosmic explosions.

        </h3>
        <p>
        A new generation of large-scale spectroscopic stellar surveys
        (e.g. SEGUE, APOGEE, Gaia-ESO) are measuring spectra for millions
        of stars across the Milky Way. 
        Ideally, each spectrum would be used to "label" the corresponding
        star with its physical characteristics (e.g. temperature)
        and physical labels would be independent of the
        pipeline used to measure them.
        However, in practice, 
        survey pipelines measure inconsistent labels for the same stars,
        because their methodologies are sensitive to properties that differ between surveys (e.g. wavelength range and resolution).
        </p>
        <p>
        <i> The Cannon </i> is a data-driven approach to spectral modeling
        that can be used to bring two discrepant surveys onto the same scale.
        <i> The Cannon</i> requires no physical models, is very fast,
        and achieves comparable accuracy to existing survey pipelines
        but with significantly lower SNR spectra.
        It relies only on the existence of a subset of objects within a survey
        for which the corresponding labels are known and sufficiently cover
        the label space of interest.

        </h3>
        <p>
            Our position within the Milky Way gives us a unique
            vantage point: we can measure the galactic magnetic
            field shape and structure over several orders of magnitude,
            ranging from parsec to several parsec scales. 
            The dense millisecond pulsar (MSP) populations in
            globular clusters (GCs) provide a unique opportunity to
            measure and map the galactic magnetic field on small 
            (pc) scales, using the Faraday rotation technique.
        </p>
        <p>
            The globular cluster Terzan 5 has the highest-known
            population of MSPs: radio flux measurements predict
            a much higher total than the current population of 35.
            Ransom (2007) used timing solutions for each MSP to calculate
            precise positions and precise DMs to demonstrate that
            differences in DM are dominated by electron density fluctuations
            in the ISM, rather than within the cluster. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As a summer student at the NRAO (a program funded by the NSF)
            I used nearly five full days of 1.5 GHz and 2 GHz Green Bank
            Telescope data to calculate precise rotation measures (RMs) for 24
            of the 35 millisecond pulsars in Terzan 5.
            Dividing these values by the corresponding DMs enabled me to measure
            the mean line-of-sight galactic magnetic field strength to
            each pulsar. I found a 15-20% gradient in line-of-sight magnetic
            field strength across the cluster with fluctuations on the order
            of 0.1 microGauss and measured a structure function power law index
            of alpha = 1.13 +/- 0.15.
