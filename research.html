        My expertise is in time-domain astronomy, particularly the use of
        ground-based optical surveys for large-scale supernova discovery
        and classification,
        and in developing data-driven tools for modeling stellar spectra using
        massively multiplexed spectrographs like LAMOST.
        My primary scientific interests are engine-driven explosions
        (gamma-ray burst afterglows AT2018cow) and pre-supernova mass-loss.

        </h3>
        <p>
            In the death of a massive star, the core collapses into a black hole
            and a spherical shock unbinds the outer layers in a core-collapse supernova.
            In rare cases (0.1%), the rapidly spinning black hole acts as an engine
            that drives a relativistic bipolar jet, which tunnels through the star
            and is visible to us as a gamma-ray burst (GRB).
            Recent evidence suggests that GRBs are just the tip of the iceberg of
            a much broader landscape of jet and central engine phenomena.
            This landscape could include jets with a higher baryon loading fraction
            ("dirty fireballs"), choked jets, and jets that are viewed off-axis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Undertaking the first census of these phenomena is one of the primary
            goals of the
            <a href="https://www.ptf.caltech.edu/ztf">Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)</a>. 
            We will address key physical questions such as:
            How many SNe actually produce central engines?
            Why do ``classical" GRB jets accelerate only a tiny fraction of their mass?
            Do low-luminosity GRBs result from jets getting choked within the star?
            And, finally, how accurate is our understanding of beaming in GRBs?
        </p>
        <p>
            False positives such as flaring stars and AGN present an impediment
            to discovering relativistic transients.
            To address this issue,
            I conducted a
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00949">systematic search of the iPTF archive</a>
            to develop a strategy for mitigation.
            I have also been using the Very Large Array (VLA) to follow up
            a mysterious population of short soft X-ray flashes
            discovered by the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI).
            The short duration, flux, hardness ratio,
            and lack of known counterpart to these events makes them promising
            candidate dirty fireballs.

        </h3>
        <p>
        A new generation of large-scale spectroscopic stellar surveys
        (e.g. SEGUE, APOGEE, Gaia-ESO) are measuring spectra for millions
        of stars across the Milky Way. 
        Ideally, each spectrum would be used to "label" the corresponding
        star with its physical characteristics (e.g. temperature)
        and physical labels would be independent of the
        pipeline used to measure them.
        However, in practice, 
        survey pipelines measure inconsistent labels for the same stars,
        because their methodologies are sensitive to properties that differ between surveys (e.g. wavelength range and resolution).
        </p>
        <p>
        <i> The Cannon </i> is a data-driven approach to spectral modeling
        that can be used to bring two discrepant surveys onto the same scale.
        <i> The Cannon</i> requires no physical models, is very fast,
        and achieves comparable accuracy to existing survey pipelines
        but with significantly lower SNR spectra.
        It relies only on the existence of a subset of objects within a survey
        for which the corresponding labels are known and sufficiently cover
        the label space of interest.

        </h3>
        <p>
            Our position within the Milky Way gives us a unique
            vantage point: we can measure the galactic magnetic
            field shape and structure over several orders of magnitude,
            ranging from parsec to several parsec scales. 
            The dense millisecond pulsar (MSP) populations in
            globular clusters (GCs) provide a unique opportunity to
            measure and map the galactic magnetic field on small 
            (pc) scales, using the Faraday rotation technique.
        </p>
        <p>
            The globular cluster Terzan 5 has the highest-known
            population of MSPs: radio flux measurements predict
            a much higher total than the current population of 35.
            Ransom (2007) used timing solutions for each MSP to calculate
            precise positions and precise DMs to demonstrate that
            differences in DM are dominated by electron density fluctuations
            in the ISM, rather than within the cluster. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As a summer student at the NRAO (a program funded by the NSF)
            I used nearly five full days of 1.5 GHz and 2 GHz Green Bank
            Telescope data to calculate precise rotation measures (RMs) for 24
            of the 35 millisecond pulsars in Terzan 5.
            Dividing these values by the corresponding DMs enabled me to measure
            the mean line-of-sight galactic magnetic field strength to
            each pulsar. I found a 15-20% gradient in line-of-sight magnetic
            field strength across the cluster with fluctuations on the order
            of 0.1 microGauss and measured a structure function power law index
            of alpha = 1.13 +/- 0.15.
