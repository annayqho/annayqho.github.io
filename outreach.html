            <li> MIT: I spent one month with Teach For America, teaching math
            on the Pueblo Pintado Navajo reservation. 
            Over the next few years, I taught 12 different classes
            for over 500 middle- and high-school students and their parents
            through MIT's
            <a href="https://esp.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Educational Studies Program (ESP)</a>.     
            The subject material ranged from scientific
            (e.g. an eight-week course on cosmology)
            to literary (e.g. a three-hour dramatic read-through of
            Tom Stoppard's <i>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead</i>)
            to improvised (e.g.
            <a href="http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/spontaneous-5-minute-classes-on-whatever-you-want" target="_blank">improvised 5-minute lessons</a> with
            topics decided by the audience on the spot).
            During my junior year, MIT sponsored me to travel as an
            ambassador to Stanford to teach for their ESP program.
            <li> Germany: I designed and taught <a href="http://annastronomer.tumblr.com/post/109665878629/cosmology-hands-on" target="_blank">
            a cosmology workshop</a> for local high-school students. </li>
            <li> Pasadena: I designed and taught an eight-week class
           on multiwavelength astronomy for gifted 7-12 year olds at the 
           <a href="http://educationaladvancement.org/" target="_blank">Institute for Educational Advancement</a>.

        <ul>
            <li> 2010-2014: I was one of four members of MIT's Class of 2014
            selected to be <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/author/annayq" target="_blank">an MIT admissions blogger</a>.
            For four years, I wrote
            <a href="https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/author/annayq" target="_blank">biweekly blog posts</a> 
            with the goal of making undergraduate life more transparent
            to prospective students from around the world.
            The website is visited by a quarter of a million people per month,
            and I enjoyed corresponding with prospective students,
            answering questions about science careers, and offering
            suggestions for high school preparation.
            One of my blog posts was <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2011/my-four-weeks-view-us-achievement-gap" target="_blank">featured</a> on the MIT News website
            and <a href="https://aas.org/posts/blog/2014/04/congressional-visits-day-undergraduate-perspective" target="_blank">another</a> by the AAS.
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/20ac4w/til_that_before_neil_degrasse_tyson_went_on_the/" target="_blank">One of them</a> was on the front page of Reddit!
            I still occasionally contribute to the site.
            </li>
            <li> 2014: I won First Place in the
            <a href="http://cmsw.mit.edu/publications/ilona-karmel-writing-prizes/"
                target="_blank"> DeWitt Wallace Prize</a> for Science Writing for the Public
            and was awarded an
            <a href="http://odge.mit.edu/finances/fellowships/odgefellowships/#green"
                target="_blank">Ida M. Green Fellowship</a> from the Science Writing department. </li>
            <li> 2015: I wrote a <a href="http://www.mpia.de/news/science/2015-03-biosignatures"
                target="_blank">press release</a> for the Max Planck Institute
            for Astronomy and wrote a <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/120820/distant-stellar-nurseries-this-time-in-high-definition/" target="_blank">blog post</a> for the UniverseToday news site.
            <li> 2018: I wrote <a href=https://caltechletters.org/science/cosmic-forensics
                target="_blank">an article about cosmic forensics</a>
            for the Caltech Letters website.
            <li> 2019: I wrote <a href=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/sma/Newsletters/pdfFiles/SMA_NewsJan2019.pdf"
                target="_blank">an article for the SMA Newsletter</a> on the spectacular transient AT2018cow.

            <li> I participated in <a href="http://www.setcvd.org/" target="_Blank">Congressional Visits Day</a> in 2014 and 2017,
            first as a representative of the American Astronomical Society
            and then through Caltech.

                target="_blank">a presentation on managing Space Traffic.</a></li>
            <li> Through SEPAC and the GSC, I run events to help
            give graduate students a sense for what careers might be
            available to them in science policy, lunch discussions
            on a variety of topics from space traffic to federal
            nutrition guidelines,
            and trips to visit policymakers in Sacramento and Washington, D.C.
